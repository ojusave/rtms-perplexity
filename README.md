# Real-Time Meeting Transcript Processor with Perplexity Search

This application demonstrates real-time processing of Zoom meeting transcripts using RTMS (Real-Time Media Streaming) service, integrated with Claude 3 Sonnet for action item extraction and Perplexity API for real-time information search.

## Features

- üéØ Real-time transcript processing and analysis using Claude 3 Sonnet
- üìã Automatic action item extraction from meeting conversations
- üîç Real-time information search using Perplexity API
- üß† Context-aware processing with rolling conversation history
- üîÑ Intelligent deduplication of action items
- üí™ Robust WebSocket connection handling

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Zoom account with RTMS enabled
- Zoom App credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- Zoom Secret Token for webhook validation
- Anthropic API key for Claude 3 Sonnet access
- Perplexity API key for real-time information search

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rtms-perplexity
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
ZOOM_SECRET_TOKEN=your_secret_token
ZM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python print_transcripts.py
```

2. Expose the local server (running on port 3000) using ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Configure your Zoom App:
   - Go to the Zoom App Marketplace
   - Navigate to your app's settings
   - Set the webhook URL to your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url/webhook`)

4. Start a Zoom meeting with RTMS enabled to begin processing:
   - The server will receive and process incoming transcripts
   - Claude 3 Sonnet will analyze conversations for action items
   - Perplexity API will handle real-time information searches
   - Both transcripts and extracted information will be displayed in the console

## Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

### 1. Zoom RTMS Handler (`print_transcripts.py`)
- Manages webhook events from Zoom
- Handles WebSocket connections to Zoom's servers
- Processes real-time transcript data
- Routes transcript chunks to the LangChain processor

### 2. LangChain Processor (`langchain_processor.py`)
- Processes incoming transcript chunks
- Uses Claude 3 Sonnet (via LangChain) for conversation analysis
- Extracts action items and information needs
- Maintains a rolling window of recent transcript chunks
- Coordinates with Perplexity search for information needs

### 3. Perplexity Search (`perplexity_search.py`)
- Handles real-time information searches
- Integrates with Perplexity's API
- Provides context-aware search results
- Formats search results for meeting context

## Dependencies

```
fastapi==0.68.1
uvicorn==0.15.0
websockets==10.1
python-dotenv==0.19.0
```

## Best Practices

- Keep the `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Monitor WebSocket connections for stability
- Consider implementing persistent storage for action items in production
- Regularly validate and update API credentials
- Test the system with various meeting scenarios and search queries
